# BUG-016: Missing focus trap in modals

**Severity:** Medium
**Status:** Fixed
**Found by:** audit
**Assigned to:** fixer-2
**Created:** 2025-12-25 15:41

## Description
Modals (GachaModal, CollectionModal) don't trap focus, allowing users to tab to elements behind the modal.

Impact:
- Keyboard users can navigate to hidden elements
- Screen reader users lose context
- Violates WCAG 2.1 accessibility guidelines

Expected: Focus should be trapped within modal while open
Actual: Tab key allows focus to escape modal boundaries

Affected components:
- GachaModal.tsx
- CollectionModal.tsx

Recommended solution:
1. Extract reusable Modal component with built-in focus trap
2. Use focus-trap-react or implement custom solution
3. Set focus to first interactive element on open
4. Return focus to trigger element on close

Severity: Medium - Accessibility issue
