# BUG-020: No user feedback on action failures

**Severity:** Low
**Status:** Fixed
**Found by:** audit
**Assigned to:** fixer-2
**Created:** 2025-12-25 15:42

## Description
Care actions (feed, play, sleep, clean) fail silently when conditions aren't met. Users get no feedback explaining why an action didn't work.

Scenarios with no feedback:
1. No active pet selected (shouldn't happen but could)
2. Stat already at maximum
3. Any other failure condition

Current behavior:
- Button press animation plays
- Nothing happens
- User confused

Expected behavior:
- Toast/notification explaining why action failed
- Visual feedback (button shake, error color)
- Clear message: "Hunger already at 100%" or "No pet selected"

Suggested implementation:
- Add toast notification system
- Return error messages from store actions
- Display errors in UI briefly
- Consider disabling buttons when action not available

File: src/components/ActionButtons.tsx, src/stores/gameStore.ts
Severity: Low - UX improvement
Reference: AUDIT_REPORT.md LOW-004
