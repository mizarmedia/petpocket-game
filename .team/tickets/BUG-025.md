# BUG-025: App permanently stuck on loading screen - _hasHydrated never set

**Severity:** Critical
**Status:** Open
**Found by:** audit

## Description
CRITICAL BUG: Application is stuck on "Loading..." screen and never progresses.

Root cause: _hasHydrated flag never gets set to true

Location: src/stores/gameStore.ts lines 649-670
Expected: onRehydrateStorage callback sets _hasHydrated to true after hydration
Actual: _hasHydrated stays false permanently, blocking all app functionality

Impact: **APP IS COMPLETELY UNUSABLE** - users see only "Loading..." screen

The onRehydrateStorage callback at line 649-670 should set _hasHydrated but appears to not be executing or failing silently.

App.tsx line 120-129 blocks all rendering until _hasHydrated is true.

This is a BLOCKING BUG - nothing works until this is fixed.

Severity: CRITICAL - Complete application failure
Priority: IMMEDIATE FIX REQUIRED
