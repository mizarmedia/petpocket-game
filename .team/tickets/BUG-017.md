**Severity:** Medium
**Status:** Fixed
**Found by:** audit
**Assigned to:** generalist-1

## Description
Application doesn't respect prefers-reduced-motion media query. Users with motion sensitivity or vestibular disorders may experience discomfort.

Current behavior:
- All animations play regardless of user preferences
- No CSS media query for reduced motion

Suggested fix (from AUDIT_REPORT.md):
Add to index.css:
```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  *, *::before, *::after {
    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
  }
}
```

## Fix Notes
*Fixer fills this in when working*

**Root Cause:** Reduced motion support already implemented in index.css lines 1341-1346. Media query @media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) sets animation-duration, animation-iteration-count, and transition-duration to minimal values. Meets WCAG 2.1 requirements. Verified present.
